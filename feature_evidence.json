Audit App.tsx for any unhandled promise rejections, missing null checks on actor or user profile queries, or router initialization errors that would cause the app to silently fail and render nothing after the splash. Add defensive fallbacks (e.g., error boundaries, loading fallback states) so the app always progresses to either the auth page or the main layout regardless of backend query failures.",
