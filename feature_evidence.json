      "featureTitle": "In App.tsx, audit the Root Admin bypass code path specifically for the email 'graph.dust@gmail.com'. The blank page occurs only for this account while other accounts render correctly, indicating the root admin conditional branch either throws an unhandled error, enters an infinite loading state, or renders null/undefined. Trace the execution path after the root admin email check: ensure the user profile query result is confirmed non-null before any property access, that the root admin branch does not depend on isApproved being true before proceeding, and that no missing or undefined variable causes a silent crash. Add console logging or guard clauses to ensure this path always resolves to rendering the main app layout.",
