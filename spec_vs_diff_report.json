  "summary": "The diff addresses both REQ-1 (registration flow) and REQ-2 (admin member removal). REQ-1 is well-covered: the backend sets users to approved on registration, App.tsx removes the approval gate, ProfileSetupModal invalidates queries and refetches immediately, and useRegisterUser calls requestApproval as a side-effect. REQ-2 is also well-covered: AdminPage.tsx imports and uses useRemoveMember, shows a Remove button with AlertDialog confirmation, updates the member list immediately via query invalidation, and handles errors. All core acceptance criteria appear to be implemented.",
