  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required fixes: an ErrorBoundary component is added (REQ-28), App.tsx is overhauled with defensive loading states and fallback UI paths (REQ-27), and useQueries.ts adds explicit isLoading/isError handling with actor guards (REQ-29). However, some specific acceptance criteria cannot be fully confirmed due to truncation of App.tsx, and the ErrorBoundary is not clearly shown wrapping the root in main.tsx.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "A React ErrorBoundary component must wrap the root App component in main.tsx or equivalent non-immutable entry point.",
      "reason": "The ErrorBoundary component is created in frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx, but the diff does not show main.tsx being modified to wrap the App component with it. Without a change to main.tsx, the boundary may not be at the root level.",

      "reason": "The build request does not request creation of a new WaitingForApproval component. While a waiting state may be needed for flow, creating a new dedicated component goes beyond the stated requirements which focused on fixing blank pages and adding error boundaries.",
