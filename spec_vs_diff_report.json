  "summary": "The build request is a pure retry of the last failed deployment with no code changes required. The diff shows 14 modified files with actual code content present (frontend pages, backend, hooks, etc.). Since this is a retry, the files shown represent the existing codebase being redeployed. The changes visible in the diff appear to be pre-existing code rather than new modifications introduced in this diff. Based on the frontend-file-summaries.txt, these changes are described as existing features being re-deployed. REQ-12 requires a successful build and deployment of previously implemented features with no new code changes.",
